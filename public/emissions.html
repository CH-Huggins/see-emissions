                Have you ever wondered how much emissions are when mentioned in an
                article? Far too often do news sites use numbers in esoteric ways
                that exclude the general population. Well now, you have a place to
                take those numbers to get more information on them.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Here is where you can enter your emissions, either in the units of 
                tonnes of CO2 or in electricity usage (kWh). These numbers can
                typically be found in news articles or scientific journals. There
                are other sources for these numbers, but this is where you will most
                normally find them.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Enter the number you want to research in the text box, and select
                the form of emissions that you would like to check on. Then click submit
                and there you go, the emission's comparisons will be provided.
