                See Emissions was created in order to present pollution in a more
                understandable way. Climate change conversations are based around
                science which automatically removes a good bit of the population
                from the discussion. However, in order to combat climate chage,
                we need to all be united. So given CO2 emissions or energy usage,
                you can come here and find out how that actually compares to
                other activities or people.
